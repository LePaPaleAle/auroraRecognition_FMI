# Edit this file to introduce tasks to be run by cron.
# 
# Each task to run has to be defined through a single line
# indicating with different fields when the task will be run
# and what command to run for the task
# 
# To define the time you can provide concrete values for
# minute (m), hour (h), day of month (dom), month (mon),
# and day of week (dow) or use '*' in these fields (for 'any').# 
# Notice that tasks will be started based on the cron's system
# daemon's notion of time and timezones.
# 
# Output of the crontab jobs (including errors) is sent through
# email to the user the crontab file belongs to (unless redirected).
# 
# For example, you can run a backup of all your user accounts
# at 5 a.m every week with:
# 0 5 * * 1 tar -zcf /var/backups/home.tgz /home/
# 
# For more information see the manual pages of crontab(5) and cron(8)
# 
# m h  dom mon dow   command

# Call the shell scripts that activate the conda environment and call the 
# getLatest...-scripts for Kevo and Muonio every minute from 09:00 to 14:59
* 9-14 * * * /home/users/moisio/testing/run_getLatest_KEV_MUO_testing.sh >/dev/null 2>&1

# Same thing for the morningRoutine... -scripts for Kevo and Muonio. 
# Call this script only once, at 15:15 in the afternoon
15 15 * * * /home/users/moisio/testing/run_KEV_MUO_morningRoutine.sh >/dev/null 2>&1
